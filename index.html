<p><i>"As my direct report, I got to see Andy 'in-action.' He's calm, cool and collected; he manages the situation at-hand and doesn't predict too far ahead. He's flexible and relatable. Andy knows the value of listening carefully and asking the right questions at the right time. He makes decisions based on data, but he's willing to give new ideas a chance."</i> - Courtney Arango, IPL Media Relations/Spokesperson</p>
<p><i>"Andy is a master at keeping his cool and balancing the demands of what is virtually a small city -- better known as the Indiana State Fair. Although he had the demands of hundreds of other exhibitors, the traditional State Fair stories, and the typical semi-crises, he always made us and our client feel like we were the only group he had to worry about. He was well versed on our exhibition and and was wonderful at channeling media opportunities to us. Above all he kept 10,000 plates spinning, never hitting the ground, and he never broke a sweat."</i> - David Shank, Shank Public Relations President</p>
